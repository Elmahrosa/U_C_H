Subject: Production-Ready Telehealth Platform — Pi Network Mainnet (Live Demo)

Hi [Name],

I'm Ayman from Elmahrosa International, an Egyptian blockchain technology company operating since 2007.

We've built and deployed a complete telehealth infrastructure platform — Unity Care Hospital. It's live on Pi Network Mainnet today.

Platform capabilities:
• Doctor consultations with audit trail
• WebRTC telemedicine video
• Pharmacy delivery with e-prescription
• Emergency dispatch via Twilio
• AI health assistant (Arabic, English, French)
• IoT vital sign monitoring
• Blockchain audit layer (optional)
• White-label: full rebrand via one config file

White-label telehealth market: $11.5B today → $55.6B by 2030 (25.1% CAGR).
Pi Network: 70 million users — zero healthcare dApps at scale.

Live demo: https://unitycare.teosegypt.com
Pi app: https://salmaunitycareho3075.pinet.com

I can grant read access to the full GitHub repository for technical due diligence.

Available for exclusive regional licensing or full IP transfer.

Worth 15 minutes?

## Objection Handling

**"Why would I buy this instead of building it?"**  
> Building costs $40K–$300K and 6–18 months. This is fully deployed today with Pi Network integration that would take a year to replicate.

**"Pi Network has no real value yet."**  
> The SDK is modular and removable. The underlying healthcare platform works with any payment system. Pi integration is upside, not dependency.

**"How do I know this works?"**  
> Live demo at https://unitycare.teosegypt.com. Request GitHub read access for full technical review. DEMO_CREDENTIALS.md included.

**"Can you customize it for my region?"**  
> Yes. Full rebrand via branding-config.ts. Multilingual: Arabic, English, French already built in.

**"What happens after purchase?"**  
> Full GitHub repository transfer + Pi developer portal transfer + 30-day handover support.

## 3) First 5 target archetypes
1) Gulf hospital group modernizing teleconsultation (5–10 hospitals)
2) MENA government pilot program for national telehealth expansion
3) African regional hospital network digitizing outpatient services
4) VC-backed telehealth startup lacking backend infrastructure
5) Insurance-backed health network expanding remote services

---

## 4) Acquisition phases
**Phase 1 (Months 1–3):** open 5–8 institutional conversations (LinkedIn + referrals + demos)  
**Phase 2 (Months 3–6):** close 1 paid pilot / or discounted license entry  
**Phase 3 (Months 6–12):** convert pilot into tier contract + publish case study

---

## 5) Funnel math (conservative)
To close 1 ownership-tier deal:
- ~10 serious conversations
- ~3 formal proposals
- 1–2 executive demos

---

## 6) Discipline metrics
Track monthly:
- conversations opened
- NDAs signed
- demos delivered
- proposals submitted
- pilots executed
- close probability % per deal

---

## 7) Objection handling
- “Why not Teladoc?” → “We are infrastructure ownership, not consumer volume.”
- “Why not build internally?” → “Internal build is 18–24 months; we deploy under 6.”
- “Compliance?” → “HIPAA-aligned; SOC2 principles applied; audits scheduled post-seed.”

# 📊 Sensitivity Analysis — 12-Month Cash Flow (UCH)
**Institutional, Conservative, Audit-Resilient**

---

## 1) Base Case (reference)
- Seed: $250K
- Ownership closes Month 6 ($250K)
- Licenses close Month 9 + 11 ($75K each)
- Maintenance Month 12 (~$1.2K)

End cash: **~$300K–$350K**

---

## 2) Downside A — Ownership slips 3 months (closes Month 9)
- Months 1–8 burn ≈ $229K
- Cash before Month 9 ≈ ~$21K
- Month 9 inflow: Ownership $250K + License $75K = $325K

Outcome:
- Survival intact but runway tight before Month 9
- Requires strict burn discipline + active pipeline management

---

## 3) Downside B — Ownership slips 6 months (closes Month 12)
- Months 1–11 burn ≈ $343K
- Seed exhausted by Month 11 without mitigation
- Month 11 inflow: +$75K partially offsets deficit
- Month 12 inflow: Ownership $250K + License $75K + maintenance ~$1.2K

Outcome:
- Survival depends on cost controls and strict prioritization
- Any additional delays risk insolvency

---

## 4) Stress Scenario — No ownership in Year 1
- Only two licenses close ($150K total)
- Burn ~$310K–$330K

Outcome:
- Insolvent without restructure or bridge capital
- Requires renegotiation of burn + alternative revenue routes

---

## 5) Strategic implications (what investors want to see)
- Ownership-tier closing is the key survival driver
- Licenses alone do not sustain runway in Year 1
- If ownership slips beyond Month 9, mitigation triggers are required:
  - freeze hiring / reduce burn
  - push paid pilots
  - negotiate milestone-based payments

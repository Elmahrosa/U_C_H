# 📊 3-Year Financial Model Framework (UCH)
**Institutional, Conservative, Audit-Resilient**

---

## 1) Revenue Model (Institutional deployments)
UCH revenue is tied to institutional deals, not consumer user growth.

### Pricing tiers (base)
- License: **$75K+**
- Ownership transfer: **$250K+**
- Sovereign stack: **$350K+**

---

## 2) Conservative Deal Ramp Assumptions
### Year 1 (Pilot Phase)
- 2 License deals → $150K
- 1 Ownership transfer → $250K
**Total: $400K**

### Year 2 (Expansion Phase)
- 6 License → $450K
- 2 Ownership → $500K
- 1 Sovereign → $350K
**Total: $1.3M**

### Year 3 (Scaling Phase)
- 12 License → $900K
- 4 Ownership → $1.0M
- 2 Sovereign → $700K
**Total: $2.6M**

---

## 3) Recurring Layer (Maintenance)
Maintenance: **15–20% of license value annually**  
Attach rate assumption: **~70%** (scope dependent)

By Year 3, maintenance ARR can reach **~$600K–$800K** depending on contracts.

---

## 4) Expense Model (Lean institutional build)
Annual operating cost (example):
- 2 Engineers: ~$120K
- Sales lead: ~$70K
- Compliance / audit prep: ~$60K
- Cloud: ~$40K
- Legal/Admin: ~$30K
**Total: ~$320K–$400K**

---

## 5) Break-even logic
Break-even can occur in Year 2 if:
- At least **8 institutional deals** close (mix dependent)
- Maintenance attaches to a majority of license deals

---

## 6) Valuation anchors (defensible)
Infrastructure-like software often valued at:
- **3x–6x ARR** conservative
- **6x–10x ARR** growth

If Year 3 ARR reaches ~$3M:
- Low: $9M
- Mid: $15M
- High: $24M

Seed discussions can be defended conservatively when tied to milestones (pilot + conversion + audit readiness).

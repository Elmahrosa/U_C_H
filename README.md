## What this repository contains

This repo ships two deliverables:

1) **Institutional Web Platform (Frontend)**
- Marketing + procurement-facing landing site
- Pilot + licensing structure
- Institutional contact + diligence positioning

2) **Institutional API (Backend)**
- Enterprise-ready API under `backend/`
- Designed for deployments where institutions control data and hosting

---

## Core Positioning

**Teladoc / Amwell:** subscription SaaS, centralized model, no ownership transfer.  
**UCH:** deployable stack that can be **licensed or fully acquired**, enabling sovereign or private institutional control.

- Modular telehealth infrastructure for institutional deployment
- Dedicated instance deployment (isolation per institution)
- Region-specific hosting options
- Crypto settlement capability is optional (not required)

---

## Commercial Structure (Board-Ready)

| Tier | Model | Price (baseline) | Notes |
|------|-------|------------------|------|
| Tier 1 | License | $75K+ | Institutional deployment + white-label |
| Tier 2 | Ownership Transfer | $250K+ | Asset transfer of stack + handover |
| Tier 3 | Sovereign Stack | $350K+ | Government / national program deployment |

**Pilot (3–6 months):** paid validation phase with conversion credit toward the final tier.

---

## Compliance posture (truthful & audit-aligned)

- HIPAA-aligned architecture (role-based access, encrypted transmission, audit logging)
- SOC 2 principles applied at architecture level
- Formal certification audits are scheduled **post-seed funding**

> We do not claim certifications prematurely.
